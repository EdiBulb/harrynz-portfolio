      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Hello! I'm Byeonghun Kang, a passionate software engineering student based in New Zealand ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿.  
        I enjoy building modern web and mobile applications using tools like React, Flutter, and Firebase.  
        I'm currently focused on developing real-world portfolio projects and seeking graduate roles where I can learn and contribute to meaningful software products.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
        In addition to coding, I love traveling, making videos, and sharing my journey through my YouTube channel ðŸŽ¥.
        I believe that opportunities aren't given, but created â€” and I'm here to create mine.
